    <h2> Antarctica</h2>
<p>That’s right, we put an entire continent on here. <br>Although 99 percent of Antarctica is covered with <br>ice, the landscape still manages to be stunningly <br>diverse—surreal blue glaciers, active volcanoes, <br>the rough waterways of the Drake Passage, and <br>360-degree views of untouched snow. And those views <br>are made even better when an emperor penguin or <br>humpback whale makes an appearance.</p>
