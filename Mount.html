    <h2>Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania</h2>
<p>Africa’s highest peak seems more striking than a lot <br>of other famous mountains, because it’s an ancient<br> stratovolcano that’s not part of any <br>mountain range. That means the 19,000-foot summit <br>drops down to vast, flat plains on all sides, <br>making it a mirage-like blip on Tanzania’s <br>widespread topography. As an added bonus, the peak <br>requires no technical mountaineering skills to <br>summit, so even novice hikers can cross this item <br>off their bucket list.</p>
